API name,Type of issue,Description of the issue,Your ID
tolower,Inconsistent,"The return type is specified as an integer, but the function actually returns a string",212900211
find,Incomplete,"There is no clarification on whether the search is case-sensitive, if overlapping results are included, or what the output is when no match exists",212900211
substring,Incomplete,It is unclear what occurs when the end value exceeds the string's length or lies outside its valid range,212900211
anagrams,Incomplete,The specification does not clarify which dictionary or wordlist is used to determine valid anagrams,212900211
substring,Not correct,"The explanations for start and end are swapped: start is defined as end, and end is defined as start",212900211
time,Ambiguous,"The description is overly brief. It doesn't specify the precise time format, the time zone, or the meaning of ""debug purposes",212900211
reset_server,Ambiguous,It is uncertain whether resetting the server impacts all users or only the active session,212900211
substring,Incomplete,?It is not clarified what occurs if start is greater than end – does it result in an error or return an empty string,212900211
storage,Not correct,"The return type is indicated as str, but it may vary based on the command type – this is not explained",212900211
find,Infeasible,Allowing the substring to be longer than the main string is illogical,212900211
mix_case,Incomplete,It is unclear if the first letter is always lowercase or if it depends on the original text – the current examples consistently begin with a lowercase letter,212900211
counter_string,Incomplete,It is not clarified what the generated string actually looks like – there is no defined format or expected output.,212900211
length,Not correct,"The return type is specified as str, but the actual return is an integer (length)",212900211
random,Incomplete,"It is not clarified what characters the random string may include (e.g., only ASCII? digits? symbols?), and no details are provided on whether the string is truly random, pseudo-random, or seed-based",212900211
general,"Incomplete
","There are missing details about input constraints (e.g., maximum string length, allowed characters), and it does not explain how special characters, spaces, or non-Latin text are managed",212900211
anagrams,Inconsistent,"The documentation mentions ""No parameters,"" yet {text} is clearly required as a path parameter",212900211
history,Inconsistent,"The return type is defined as str, but the actual output is a list containing strings (list[str])",212900211
find,Not concise,The API name and description are too vague – it’s unclear whether it returns all occurrences or just a single one,212900211
storage,Ambiguous,It is not clear if the API supports stateful operations or how it works with previously stored data,212900211
history,"Incomplete
",It does not clarify what occurs if there is no history,212900211
reverse,Inconsistent,"The described functionality doesn't align with the name or expected output – it should reverse the text, not perform calculations",212900211
history,Not necessary,"The description repeats the name (""The history of text tweaks..."") without providing any additional information",212900211
general,Not concise,"The description is too brief and doesn’t clarify behavior rules, such as whether only English letters are processed or what happens if the input is already mixed",212900211
password,Incomplete,"It is not stated how different character types (e.g., symbols, digits) impact the score",212900211
reset_server,Incomplete,"It is not clarified whether the reset is permanent or temporary, nor how long it takes",212900211
general,Incomplete,Error messages are not clearly explained for each potential failure.,212900211
anagrams,Not correct,"There is no explanation of the behavior when the input produces no results, such as with 'zzz'.",212900211
password,Ambiguous,"The phrase ""Is your password strong enough?"" is unclear – it doesn’t specify what qualifies as ""strong enough",212900211
storage,Incomplete,"The purpose of the index query parameter is not clarified—its usage, range, and meaning are unclear. Additionally, the behavior when invalid or malformed commands are provided is not documented",212900211
